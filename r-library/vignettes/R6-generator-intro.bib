Compared to reference classes, R6 classes are simpler and lighter-weight, and they are not built on S4 classes so they do not require the methods package. These classes allow public and private members, and they support inheritance, even when the classes are defined in different packages.},

The 'jsr223'-supported programming languages include 'Groovy', 'JavaScript', 'JRuby' ('Ruby'), 'Jython' ('Python'), and 'Kotlin'. Any of these languages can use and extend 'Java' classes in natural syntax. Furthermore, solutions developed in any of the 'jsr223'-supported languages are also accessible to 'R' developers. The 'jsr223' package also features callbacks, script compiling, and string interpolation. In all, 'jsr223' significantly extends the computing capabilities of the 'R' software environment.},
